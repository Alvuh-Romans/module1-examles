        <h1>Dont be afriad to &lt; than a 100% success &gt; more:</h1>
            <p> "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how
                 a strong man stunbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done
                  better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually 
                 in the arena, whose face is mared by dust and sweat and blood;
                 who trives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again,
                 because there is no effort without errors and shortcoming; but who 
                 does actually trives to do the deeds; who knows great enthosiasm, 
                 the great devotions;who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at 
                 the best knows the in the end the triumph of high achievements
                 and who at the worst, if he fails atleast fails while daring greatly,
                 so that his place shall never be with those cold and &nbsb;timit &nbsb;souls
                 who neither know victory nor defeat."
